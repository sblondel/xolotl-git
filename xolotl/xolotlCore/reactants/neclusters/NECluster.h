 * The NECluster class is a Reactant that is specialized to work for

 * obtaining the cluster size.

 * NEClusters must always be initialized with a size. If the constructor is
 * passed a size of zero or less, the actual size will be set to 1.

 * The getComposition() operation is implemented by subclasses and will always
