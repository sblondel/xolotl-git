 * Reactants inherently know the other reactants with which they interact. They
 * declare their interactions with other reactants in the network after it is
 * set (setReactionNetwork) via the getConnectivity() operation. "Connectivity"
 * indicates whether two Reacants interact, via any mechanism, in an abstract
 * sense (as if they were nodes connected by an edge on a network graph).
 *
 * This is an abstract base class that only provides direct support for
 * manipulating the concentration, etc. It should be subclassed to add
