/**
 * The PSICluster class is a Reactant that is specialized to work for
 * simulations of plasma-surface interactions. It provides special routines
 * for calculating the total flux due to production and dissociation and
 * obtaining the cluster size.
 *
 * PSIClusters must always be initialized with a size. If the constructor is
 * passed a size of zero or less, the actual size will be set to 1.
 *
 * The getComposition() operation is implemented by subclasses and will always
 * return a map with the keys He, V, I, HeV or HeI. The operation getTypeName()
 * will always return one of the same values.
 *
 * As a rule, it is possible to access directly some of the private members of
 * this class (id, concentration, reactionRadius, diffusionCoefficient, size,
 * typeName) instead of using the "get" functions for performance reasons. In
 * order to change these values the "set" functions must still be used.
