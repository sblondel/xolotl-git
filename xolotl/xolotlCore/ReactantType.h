// ReactionNetworks here.  Would prefer that the ReactantTypes are
// defined in the the derived ReactionNetwork subdirectories,
// so that ReactionNetworks can define those for only those that
// it knows about.
//
// C++ doesn't support derivation of enum classes, such that we
// could define a base set of ReactantTypes and then extend it
// by the specific types of reaction networks.
//
// Since Reactant keeps its own type, and the other parts of the code
// also use these reactant types without distinguishing whether they
// have a PSIClusterReactionNetwork or NEClusterReactionNetwork,
// and because support for both types of reaction entworks is always built,
// for now we're stuck defining all potential reactant types in this shared
// enum.
//
// We could finesse the problem using preprocessor tricks, e.g., by
// including a file from the psiclusters and neclusters directories
// in the appropriate place in the enum definition.
//
// Note: do not assume that the values of these enums correspond to
// those in the Species enum.
